# Medical Report Visualiser - AN AI TOOL

# 🧠 Medical Report Visualiser

A full-stack AI-powered web application that helps patients understand their medical blood glucose reports through OCR-based data extraction and dynamic visualisation. Built using **React**, **Node.js**, and **Tesseract OCR**, this tool simplifies health data for better accessibility and medical autonomy.

> 🎓 Developed as part of my final year Biomedical Engineering thesis at the University of Mumbai (2022).
